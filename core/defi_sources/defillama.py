"""Module simulating DeFiLlama data for local testing.

This lightweight stub provides a :func:`get_pools` function returning a
hardâ€‘coded list of liquidity pool dictionaries.  It allows the rest of the
application (e.g. ``main.py``) to run in environments without network access or
external dependencies.

The data here is purely fictitious and serves only as a placeholder for real
API responses.
